Fake News Prediction System using Machine Learning with Python aims to classify news articles or textual information as either real or fake.
We used Logistic Regression technique for this model.
Logistic Regression is a commonly used machine learning algorithm for binary classification problems.

Here's how the system generally works:

Dataset Preparation: You need a labeled dataset consisting of news articles or textual data, where each sample is labeled as real or fake. This dataset will be used to train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model.

Feature Extraction: In order to use the textual data as input for the model, you need to extract relevant features. Commonly used techniques include word frequency-based approaches like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe. These techniques transform the textual data into numerical representations that can be processed by the machine learning model.

Dataset Split: Split the labeled dataset into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the Logistic Regression model, while the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

Model Training: Train the Logistic Regression model using the training set and the extracted features. The model learns to classify news articles as either real or fake based on the patterns and relationships present in the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using the test set. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model can classify real and fake news.

Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict the authenticity of new, unseen news articles or textual data. The model will output a probability score indicating the likelihood of the article being real or fake.

It's important to note that building an effective fake news prediction system requires careful consideration of the dataset, feature engineering techniques, and model selection. Additionally, it's crucial to continuously update and refine the system to adapt to evolving patterns of fake news.
